Packages under org.lemsml.jld implement of the API ModelReader and ModelWriter interfaces
using the parser and xml elements from jLEMSDev.

It is not recommended to rely on this for production use. 

Rather, the functionality in the jld package could be achieved with a variety of standard 
tools for parsing xml files and and instantiating java classes.
