jld.imodel contains interfaces to the resolved dimensionless version of the model in which all quantities are 
expressed in SI units.

These are (or at least will be) the only input to hsim/StateTypeBuilder which builds an executable version of the model. 
The same should hold for the output to LemsLite with a corresponding LesmLiteBuilder.
