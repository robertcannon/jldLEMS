Get rid of componentReference
Just use Child, 


<ComponentType name="channeldensity">
	<Child type="channel"/>
</ComponentType>

   
<Component type="chaneldensity"> 
	<Channel source="id_of_ref_channel"/>
</Component>
    

<Component type="chaneldensity"> 
	<Channel source="id_of_other_cpt"> 
   		 <Override parameter="gates/k/scale"  value="3"/>
	</Channel>
</Component>
 
     
<Component type="chaneldensity"> 
	<Channel g="2">
		<Gate a="1" b="3"/>
		<Gate a="1" b="3"/>
	</Channel>
</Component>
    
  
  
  
If cpt has structure block don't do default instantiation

When instantiating ComponentTypes, create separate classes for Dynamics
and Structure - resolving code etc goes in these classes not in ComponentType 
or Component. Same for Geometry etc in future.



With, padraig's example where 
synapse contains spiking element which contains connection all in 
component type definition. With in structure wants instance to resolve relative
to the component directly on type definition, not on params of declared component.

LEMS_NML_Ex16_Inputs.xml example in experimental branch of nml2


Check why accessing children by index doesn't work injLEMS when declared as a list going in a Children element
onlySI.getChildren?


API: generate node tree of instantiated model with params, state variables etc
 Or just make and expose set of peers
 
Also access to lems "documents" so can create and query 



"extends" for components - not clear what it really means. Should only use for ComponentTypes














Instance variables - channel populations that change a property of a channel (vshift) from place to place.

Possibility of inheriting behaviors between component types? Not sure - why? Only case so far is 
if extension type adds a param that children need but the component itself does not need.

Exec test for component flattening - check get same results with 
   tree, flattened component behavior, and flattneed component.

Networks - examples with morphological synapses and logical synapses.
